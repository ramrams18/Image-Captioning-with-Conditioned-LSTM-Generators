# Image-Captioning-with-Conditioned-LSTM-Generators on flickr8k Data

Pytorch Implementation 

->Training is done in  the notebook as well as inference towards the end

->I have created multiple models which are tested in different epochs and their varrying performence

->To change the model encoder and decoder simply load the appropriate decoder-num_epoch.pkl file

->Lot more traingin is required to get accurate predictions like more then 3 epochs

->the predictions as of right now are somewhat accurate

->Epoch [3/3], Loss: 2.2159, Perplexity: 9.1694 --> so requires more training with different hyper parameters
